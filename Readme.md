# Roadmp.sh Frontend Project Submissions

In this repository I will keep all my frontend projects submitted to <a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects?g=frontend">Roadmap.sh</a>. The projects on Roadmap.sh range from beginner to advanced. I will try to complete all the projects.

## 1. Single Page CV
The goal of this project is to showcase how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. We will focus on laying out our education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner. Styling will be addressed in a later project.
